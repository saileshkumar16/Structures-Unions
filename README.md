# 📘 Structures & Unions in C  

This repository covers **Structures and Unions in C**, starting from the basics and gradually moving toward advanced concepts. The aim is to build a strong foundation and demonstrate how they integrate with **pointers, functions, and memory management** — essential for system-level and embedded programming.
